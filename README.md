<h1>Chapter 1: Artificial Intelligence </h1>

<h2>Intelligence</h2>
Intelligence can be defined as an ability to perceive an information and to gain knowledge from it and to apply it within an environment. Artificial intelligence is a field of data science which gives more emphasis on providing intelligence to a system and make it behave more like a human being. The field of AI is based on many principles such as:
 
1.	Philosophy
2.	Computer Science
3.	Psychology
4.	Neuron Science
5.	Biology
6.	Math
7.	Sociology
 
<h2> Applications of AI </h2>
 
1.	Computer vision
2.	Natural processing language
3.	Gaming
4.	Speech recognition
5.	Handwriting recognition
6.	Object detection
 
<h2> AI perspective </h2>

For the point of view of different researchers, there are different perspective for the AI. Some researchers define it as tunning an agent or a system to act more like a human and on the other hand some researchers define as enabling an agent to do the right thing. Therefore, on the basis of these two concepts there are four possible combination of AI perspective such as:

<ul>
  <li><h3>Acting humanly: Turing test (Alan Turing-1950)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In Turing test, an interrogator asks several questions to a human and a computer. The interrogator will not know which one of them is a human and which one is the computer. S/he will have to identify it on the basis of the answers provided by both of them and on the basis of his/her interrogation. If s/he identify computer as a human begin then the computer will pass the Turing test otherwise not.</li>
      <li>For a machine to act like human it would require computer vision as eyes for perceiving the environment. Natural language processing to communicate like human. Knowledge representation to store what it has learned and to learn/draw valuable conclusions from it. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Thinkingly humanly: Cognitive test</h3>
    There are 3 ways to know how a human mind actually works:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Introspection:</b> Trying to catch our own thoughts.</li>
      <li><b>Psychological experiment:</b> Observing person in action.</li>
      <li><b>Brain imaging:</b> Observing the brain reacting for various situations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Acting rationally: Rational agent approach</h3></li>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Agent:</b> An autonomous system that acts by perceiving the environment. Hence it acts accordingly to achieve its goals.</li>
    <li><b>Rational agent:</b> Rational agent on the other hand is similar to the agent but the only difference is that it tends to find the optional solution for any given problem.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><h3>Thinking rationally: Laws of thought approach</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>The study of mental faculties through the use of computational model.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>History of AI </h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Maturation of AI (1943-1952)</b>
    <ul>
      <li>1943: Warren McCulloch and Walter pits proposed a model of artificial neurons.</li>
      <li>1949: Donald Hebb demonstrated an updating rule for modifying the connection strength between neurons. This rule is called Hebbian learning.</li>
      <li>1950:  Alan Turing developed Turing test.</li>
    <ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Birth of AI: (1952-1956):</b>
    <ul>
      <li>1955: An Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon created the "first artificial intelligence program "Which was named as "Logic Theorist".  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>A boom of AI (1980-1987)</b>
     <ul>
      <li>Year 1980: After AI winter duration, AI came back with "Expert System". Expert systems were programmed that emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert.</li>
      <li>In the Year 1980, the first national conference of the American Association of Artificial Intelligence was held at Stanford University.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Golden year of AI (1956-1974):</b>
   <ul>
      <li>Joseph Weizenbaum created the first chatbot in 1966, which was named as ELIZA.</li>
      <li>Year 1972: The first intelligent humanoid robot was built in Japan which was named as WABOT1.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>First AI winter:</b>
     <ul>
      <li>AI winter refers to the time period when there was the shortage of funding for the research of AI by the government.</li>
      <li>During this period the interest of public in AI was decreased.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>BOOM of AI:</b>
   <ul>
      <li>Raise of expert system. Program with decision making abilities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Raise of intelligent agents:</b>
   <ul>
      <li>1997: IBM deep blue beat world chess champion.</li>
      <li>2002: AI enabled vacuum cleaner (Roomba).</li>
      <li>2006: Companies like Facebook, twitter, Netflix etc. started using AI.
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Foundation of AI</h2>
<ul>
  <li> <h3>Philosophy:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusion?</li>
